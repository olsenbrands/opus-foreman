# opus-foreman v0.5 fixture runner.
#
#   sh skills/opus-foreman/tests/run-all.sh
#
# Runs fixtures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the v0.5 implementation contract and prints
# one PASS/FAIL line per case, then a per-fixture and overall summary. Exits 0
# only if every case passed.
#
# Fixture 4 (the Grok reviewer-to-fixer runtime check) is opt-in: it makes real,
# billable Grok calls (~$0.01), so it SKIPS itself and exits 0 unless
# FOREMAN_LIVE_GROK=1 is set and the grok CLI is logged in. The observed run it
# reproduces — and the cross-profile resume refusal that grok-workers.md:146
# states as settled — is recorded in tests/evidence/fixture-4-2026-09-07.md.
#
# SAFETY: every fixture works inside its own `mktemp -d` and must never reach
# the real global state. This runner refuses to start if $FOREMAN_HOME or the
# crew-append target could resolve under the real $HOME/.foreman, and it
# fingerprints $HOME/.foreman before and after the run to prove nothing there
# changed.
