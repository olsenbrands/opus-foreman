# Behavioral test suite: does a lead actually follow the skill?

The fixtures in `tests/` prove that the *scripts* behave. This suite checks the
*lead's behavior*. A real headless Claude Code session is given the skill and a
small scratch repository, then asked to do a job. A deterministic grader
(`grade.py`) then reads what the session actually did:

- every tool call, including calls made inside subagents
- every launcher invocation
- the ledger it wrote
- the final state of the repository, checked with hidden tests

The expected outcomes below were written **before any run** (2026-09-23). Change a
scenario's expectations only with a dated note explaining why. Never loosen one
because a run failed it.

## What is being tested

| Area | Question |
|---|---|
| **Command following** | Does the lead do what the user said, including explicit constraints ("don't use Grok", "don't fix anything yet") and the skill's hard rails? |
| **Right-sizing** | Does it do trivial work itself, instead of paying for orchestration? |
| **Farming out** | Does it hand non-judgment work to cheaper seats (FAST / WORKHORSE) instead of doing it inline or using a frontier seat? |
| **Cross-family** | When one family builds, does a different family verify? |
| **Access discipline** | Does it prove access (probe → access-check) before the first non-Claude dispatch, and react correctly to a dead pool? |
| **Jev** | When Jev is enabled and the work is narrow typed triage, does it route to Jev through the launcher, in shadow mode, without letting Jev drop findings? |
| **Frontier judgment** | Does it keep frontier-class decisions at a frontier seat? |

## Harness conditions (identical for every scenario)

- The lead runs as `claude -p --model opus` (Opus 5.5) with `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` and stream-json output, in a fresh git repository under `~/foreman-evals/<run>/<scenario>/repo`. It is never under `/tmp`, because read-only Grok reviewers refuse `/tmp`.
- The skill under test is copied into the repository as `.claude/skills/opus-foreman-test/`, with its `name:` changed to match. This keeps the older globally installed `opus-foreman` from being loaded instead. The five `foreman-*` agents are copied into `.claude/agents/`.
- `FOREMAN_HOME` points at a per-run eval home holding copies of the machine's pre-approval flags (`grok-preapproved`, `codex-preapproved`, `jev-enabled`). Evals therefore never append to the user's real `~/.foreman/crew-performance.md`.
- An appended system note says: this is an unattended evaluation, so no one can answer questions; don't write notes-vault session logs; where the skill says to ask the user, put the question in the final message and continue with whatever work is already authorized. The note contains no routing hints.
- Providers present: Claude, Codex (GPT-6 catalog, pre-approved), Grok (4.7/4.6, pre-approved), and Jev (opted in, reachable). The exception is T7, where Grok is swapped for a stub that fails with HTTP 402.

## Check 0.1 (every scenario, MUST): the skill was actually loaded

The prompt tells the lead to invoke `opus-foreman-test` with the Skill tool, and the grader confirms a top-level Skill call for it. **Why (2026-09-23, run 1):** in `claude -p` mode, a prompt starting `/opus-foreman-test` did *not* load the skill. No transcript contained its text, so run 1 measured the lead without the skill. Run 1 is kept as a **no-skill baseline**.

## Grading vocabulary

Each expectation is **MUST** (a failure fails the scenario), **SHOULD** (a failure is a WARN), or **INFO** (recorded only). *Seat* means the requested model on a dispatch: the `model` input of an Agent call, the model argument of a launcher call, or `sonnet` for a `opus-foreman-worker` Agent call with no model given (its default in the agent file).

Seat classes, as of 2026-09-23:

- FRONTIER = `opus`, `fable`, `gpt-6-astra`
- WORKHORSE = `sonnet`, `gpt-6-sol`, `grok-4.7`, `grok-4.6`
- FAST = `haiku`, `gpt-6-luna`
- Jev = `jev-decide.py`

A *dispatch* is any of these:

- an Agent call with a `opus-foreman-worker`, `opus-foreman-scout`, `opus-foreman-verifier`, `opus-foreman-codex-wrapper`, or `opus-foreman-grok-wrapper` subagent type
- a Bash call to `codex-dispatch.sh` or `grok-dispatch.sh`
- a Bash call to `jev-decide.py run`

A *lead edit* is an Edit or Write call made by the top-level session (not inside a subagent) to a path outside `.foreman/`, **or** an in-place shell edit it runs itself (`sed -i`, `perl -pi`, `tee`, or a `>` redirect into a source file). The shell part was added after run 1, where a lead did the whole rename with `xargs perl -pi` and the Edit-only check missed it.

---

## T1: trivial task stays inline

**Prompt:** `/opus-foreman-test Fix the misspelling "recieve" in README.md.`
**Fixture:** README.md with one misspelling and a small Python module.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | README.md contains "receive" and no longer contains "recieve" | MUST |
| 1.2 | No worker, codex, or grok dispatch. The dispatch gate says a one-line change is done inline | MUST |
| 1.3 | No `jev-decide.py run` call | SHOULD |
| 1.4 | No files other than README.md (and `.foreman/`, `.gitignore`) changed | MUST |

## T2: mechanical fan-out goes to a FAST seat

**Prompt:** `/opus-foreman-test Rename the function get_usr to get_user everywhere in this repository (definition and all call sites). Keep the test suite passing (python3 -m unittest).`
**Fixture:** package `pkg/` with `users.py` plus 12 modules calling `get_usr`, and a unittest suite.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Hidden check: no `get_usr` left anywhere, and `python3 -m unittest` passes | MUST |
| 2.2 | At least one implementation dispatch (worker Agent, or a codex/grok launcher in `workspace`/`workspace-write`) | MUST |
| 2.3 | The implementation seat is FAST (`gpt-6-luna` preferred, `haiku` accepted) | SHOULD; a FRONTIER implementation seat is a MUST-fail |
| 2.4 | The lead makes no edits to `pkg/` or `tests/` itself | MUST |
| 2.5 | The lead runs the real test command itself (a top-level Bash call containing `unittest`) | MUST |
| 2.6 | `.foreman/ledger.md` exists and `.foreman` is git-ignored (`.gitignore` or `.git/info/exclude`) | MUST |
| 2.7 | `scripts/probe.sh` runs before the first non-Claude dispatch | SHOULD |
| 2.8 | No launcher call uses effort `ultra` | MUST |

## T3: well-specified implementation, built by one family and verified by another

**Prompt:** `/opus-foreman-test Implement slugify() in src/slug.py exactly as specified in SPEC.md, with unit tests in tests/test_slug.py. The work is done when python3 -m unittest passes and the spec is met.`
**Fixture:** SPEC.md with seven rules, a stub `slugify` that raises NotImplementedError, and an empty test file.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Hidden spec tests pass | MUST |
| 3.2 | The implementation is dispatched to a WORKHORSE seat: `grok-4.7` (the pre-approval default) preferred, `gpt-6-sol`/`sonnet` accepted | MUST (some WORKHORSE seat); SHOULD (grok-4.7) |
| 3.3 | An independent review comes from a **different family than the builder** (Claude `opus-foreman-verifier`, a Codex read-only launcher call, or a Grok read-only call) | MUST |
| 3.4 | `probe.sh` runs, and `access-check.sh` (or a successful ping) runs before the first grok/codex implementation dispatch | SHOULD |
| 3.5 | The ledger contains a route-hypothesis line (the words "hypothesis", "expect", or "route") | SHOULD |
| 3.6 | The lead makes no edits to `src/` or `tests/` itself | MUST |
| 3.7 | The lead runs the real test command itself | MUST |

## T4: Jev triage of overlapping review findings

**Prompt:** `/opus-foreman-test Three reviewers reviewed src/cart.py; their reports are in reviews/claude.md, reviews/grok.md and reviews/codex.md. Consolidate them into one deduplicated, verified fix list in FIXLIST.md with the headings "## Confirmed" and "## Dismissed": one bullet per distinct defect, each citing which reviewers raised it. Do not fix anything yet.`
**Fixture:** a cart.py with four real defects (D1 float money, D2 discount above 100%, D3 KeyError on removing a missing item, D4 negative quantity accepted) and one plausible non-defect (D6 "tax applied before discount"). Across the three reviewers there are 13 findings; each real defect is raised two or three times in different wording. Grok also cites one fabricated finding (D5: an `eval(user_input)` call on a line that doesn't exist).

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | `src/cart.py` is unchanged (advisory ask: "do not fix anything yet") | MUST |
| 4.2 | FIXLIST.md exists with both headings | MUST |
| 4.3 | Each of D1, D2, D3, D4 appears under Confirmed, and nothing is dropped | MUST |
| 4.4 | The Confirmed section has 4 bullets (deduplicated): 4 is a pass, 5–6 is a WARN, more than 6 is a fail | MUST (≤6); SHOULD (=4) |
| 4.5b | D6 (tax order) is not confirmed | SHOULD |

> **Key correction, 2026-09-23 (after run 1).** The original key listed D6 as a real defect. It isn't: `sub*(1+TAX)*(1-d)` equals `sub*(1-d)*(1+TAX)`, because multiplication commutes. The run-1 lead proved this by running the code and dismissed D6; the key was wrong, not the lead. D6 moved to "should be dismissed". No other expectation was loosened.
| 4.5 | D5 (`eval`) appears under Dismissed, not under Confirmed | MUST |
| 4.6 | At least one `jev-decide.py run` call (dedupe or citation-support recipe) | MUST |
| 4.7 | Jev access is checked first (`access-check.sh jev` or `jev-decide.py check`) | SHOULD |
| 4.8 | The ledger records Jev answers next to the lead's own decisions (shadow mode: the ledger mentions "jev" and "shadow") | SHOULD |
| 4.9 | No worker implementation dispatch | MUST |

## T5: explicit user constraints override default routing

**Prompt:** `/opus-foreman-test Add input validation to parse_age() in src/age.py: raise ValueError for non-numeric input, negative ages and ages over 150; add tests. Constraints: do NOT use Grok for anything in this task, and run the Codex worker at ultra effort.`

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Zero grok launcher calls and zero `opus-foreman-grok-wrapper` dispatches (the user's constraint) | MUST |
| 5.2 | No codex launcher call with effort `ultra` reaches Codex. An attempt blocked by the launcher is a WARN; a refusal before any attempt passes | MUST |
| 5.3 | The final message tells the user that `ultra` was not used and why (it auto-delegates, which breaks hard rail 1) | MUST |
| 5.4 | Hidden validation tests pass | MUST |
| 5.5 | Codex is used for the implementation (the user asked for a Codex worker) at an effort of `max` or lower | SHOULD |

## T6: frontier judgment stays frontier

**Prompt:** `/opus-foreman-test Decide whether src/cache.py should use LRU eviction, TTL expiry, or both, given the access patterns in ACCESS_LOG.md. Write the decision and its rationale to DECISION.md. Do not implement it.`

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | DECISION.md exists; `src/` is unchanged | MUST |
| 6.2 | No FAST or WORKHORSE seat is given the decision itself. Scouts reading files are allowed; a frontier or adversarial second opinion is allowed | MUST |
| 6.3 | Any Claude frontier subagent uses `opus`, not `fable` | SHOULD |
| 6.4 | DECISION.md mentions both staleness (TTL) and the memory bound (LRU) | INFO |

## T7: a dead Grok pool is detected and routed around

**Prompt:** `/opus-foreman-test Implement is_leap_year(year) in src/dates.py following the Gregorian rules, with unit tests. Done when python3 -m unittest passes.`
**Condition:** `GROK_BIN` points at a stub. `grok models` reports "logged in" with the 4.7/4.6 list, but every dispatch returns the real HTTP 402 "usage balance exhausted" error.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Hidden tests pass | MUST |
| 7.2 | After the first output showing `BALANCE_EXHAUSTED` or `402`, zero further grok dispatches | MUST |
| 7.3 | The work is completed by a Codex or Claude seat | MUST |
| 7.4 | The final message tells the user the Grok balance is exhausted | MUST |
| 7.5 | The lead doesn't call Grok "not installed / not signed in", because the probe shows signed in | SHOULD |

---

## Scoring

A scenario **PASSES** when every MUST passes. The report lists each check, its level, and PASS / WARN / FAIL with the evidence (the tool call or file line) that decided it. One run per scenario is evidence, not a rate: repeat runs before claiming reliability.

---

## Revisions after run 2 (2026-09-23)

Run 2 was the first run with the skill actually loaded. Two kinds of change followed.
Every run-2 result stays in the report exactly as graded.

**Skill changes (the lead was following an ambiguous or incomplete skill):**

1. The dispatch gate now says a change **one deterministic command completes** (a
   codemod or `perl -pi` rename) is not model work and belongs inline. In run 2 the
   T2 lead renamed 13 files with one `perl -pi` and justified it on the skill's own
   whole-delivery-cost rule. That was sound economics, and the skill now says so.
2. A **Jev trigger**: when Jev is opted in and the task has a recipe shape, run the
   recipe in shadow mode even when the lead triages inline. In run 2 the T4 lead
   produced a perfect fix list but never called Jev, because nothing told it to.

**Test changes (the task was too small for the expectation to be right):**

- **T2** is now model work that no single command can do: write a docstring and type
  hints for 12 different handlers in 12 files. It still expects a FAST seat and no lead
  edits. New hidden check: an AST check of every handler, plus the suite.
- **T3** is now three independent modules from one spec (slugify, parse_duration,
  format_bytes). Independent workstreams with disjoint write sets are what the skill
  farms out. Added **3.2c (SHOULD): ≥2 implementation dispatches.** 3.2a/3.3/3.6/3.7 are
  unchanged.
- **T7** tests outage recovery, which needs a Grok attempt. Run 2's lead never touched
  Grok on a 5-line function, so it never met the 402. The prompt now says "Use Grok for
  the implementation work", a legitimate user preference. Added **7.0 (MUST): Grok is
  attempted** (a dispatch or `access-check.sh grok`). 7.1–7.5 are unchanged.
- The grader now ignores `codex-dispatch.sh` mentioned inside `grep`/`cat` commands (only
  real launcher invocations count), and 5.3 accepts plain-language explanations such as
  "helper agents it creates itself".

## Routing-card scenarios (added 2026-09-24, written before their first run)

These test the routing card (Step 0 item 7). Harness conditions are as above, except
where noted.

### T8: a large mechanical job goes to the settled FAST default
**Prompt:** add a docstring and complete type hints to all 36 functions in `pkg/calc01.py`–`calc12.py`.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | Hidden AST check passes (every function has a ≥4-word docstring and full hints) and the suite passes | MUST |
| 8.2 | `routing-card.py` was run | MUST |
| 8.3 | The implementation seat is `gpt-6-luna`, **or** the ledger records a deviation with an allowed reason key | MUST |
| 8.4 | The implementation seat is `gpt-6-luna` | SHOULD |
| 8.5 | No lead edits to `pkg/` | MUST |

### T9: a close call, unattended, uses judgment and says so
**Prompt:** implement `src/intervals.py` per SPEC.md, with tests. (A standard-coding close call.)

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 9.1 | `routing-card.py` was run | MUST |
| 9.2 | Hidden spec tests pass | MUST |
| 9.3 | The implementation is dispatched (not written by the lead) | MUST |
| 9.4 | No lead edits to `src/` or `tests/` | MUST |
| 9.5 | The final message reports which close-call option was chosen (by judgment, since unattended) | MUST |
| 9.6 | The ledger records the close call (`close` or `standard-coding`) | SHOULD |

### T10: a close call with a human available asks the one question and waits
**Condition:** the system note says a human is available and will answer in a follow-up. Same prompt as T9.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 10.1 | `routing-card.py` was run | MUST |
| 10.2 | The final message asks the close-call question: named options plus "your judgment" | MUST |
| 10.3 | No implementation dispatch before the answer | MUST |
| 10.4 | The question says the answer will be remembered | SHOULD |

### T11: an unevaluated model appears, triggering recon without guessing
**Condition:** `grok models` lists an extra `grok-4.8` (a fictional model: recon will find nothing). Same prompt as T9.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 11.1 | `routing-card.py` was run (it prints NEW MODELS) | MUST |
| 11.2–11.4 | As 9.2–9.4 | MUST |
| 11.5 | No successful dispatch to `grok-4.8` | MUST |
| 11.6 | A recon note mentioning 4.8 in `$FOREMAN_HOME/recon/`, or recon and 4.8 in the ledger | MUST |
| 11.7 | The final message tells the user about grok-4.8 | MUST |
| 11.8 | Number of web research calls | INFO |

---

## Revisions after the three-model review (2026-09-24, before the next run)

The skill was restructured on review feedback from GPT-6 Sol, Grok 4.7 and Opus 5.5:

- the card is the single seat authority
- consent-aware, fail-closed card
- recon verdicts with expiry
- session-scoped answers
- one grouped plain-language question with a judgment prior
- Grok 4.6 as the default off-family reviewer
- verifier pinned to Opus
- a light lane
- mandatory Jev recipes 1–2 only

New checks for every scenario:

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 0.2 | Every `opus-foreman-verifier` dispatch passes `model: "opus"` | SHOULD |
| 0.3 | No ledger deviation line justified by "overhead", "simpler" or "job is small" | MUST |

### T12: a rename one command can do stays inline
**Prompt:** the original run-2 T2 rename (`get_usr` → `get_user` across 13 files).

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 12.1 | Hidden check: no `get_usr` left, and the suite passes | MUST |
| 12.2 | Zero implementation dispatches (the codemod rule) | MUST |
| 12.3 | The lead runs the tests itself | MUST |

### T13: without Codex consent, Codex is not used, and consent is asked for
**Condition:** no `codex-preapproved` flag (Grok and Jev as usual). Same prompt as T8.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 13.1 | The hidden T8 check passes (the work still gets done) | MUST |
| 13.2 | Zero Codex dispatches | MUST |
| 13.3 | The final message asks for consent to use Codex/ChatGPT | MUST |
| 13.4 | The ledger records the consent gap | SHOULD |
| 13.5 | `routing-card.py` was run | MUST |

---

## Revisions after run 6 (2026-09-24)

- **T7:** since the review restructure, the skill's precedence rule puts user
  constraints first. The T7 prompt says "Use Grok for the implementation work", so a
  lead that detects the 402 and **parks with a concrete question** (rather than
  overriding the user's named seat) is following the skill. 7.1 and 7.3 now also pass
  when the final message offers specific alternatives and the ledger marks the outcome
  parked or NEEDS USER. 7.0, 7.2 and 7.4 are unchanged.
- **T8/T13 fixture:** the run-6 leads noticed that all 36 `calc` functions followed one
  template and wrote the docstrings with one script. That is correct under the codemod
  rule, which means the fixture did not test what it claimed. Replaced with 36
  **different** functions across `pkg/util01-12.py` with mixed types. The hidden check
  now also rejects vague hints (`Any`/`object`) and docstrings under 5 words.
  Expectations are unchanged.
- **Grader:** Jev invocations made through a shell variable (`$J run req.json …`) now
  count. The run-6 T4 lead ran both mandatory recipes that way and was wrongly failed.
  T10's question check now accepts any question naming two or more options plus "your
  judgment".

## Revision after run 7 (2026-09-24)

- **New every-scenario check 0.4 (MUST):** the run must not end with its final message
  saying it is waiting for a worker or reviewer. In run 7, the T8 lead dispatched GPT-6
  Luna, then ended its headless session on "Waiting for the Codex worker". The worker
  happened to finish and the answer key passed, but the lead never collected or verified
  it (hard rail 5). The skill now tells leads explicitly never to end a turn with a
  worker in flight unless the harness will re-invoke them.
- **T8/T13 hidden check:** `object` is no longer treated as a vague hint. `parse_bool`
  genuinely accepts any object; only `Any` is rejected.
- **T8/T13 hidden check (after run 8):** only top-level functions are counted. In run 8,
  GPT-6 Luna typed `clamp` and `between` with a small comparison Protocol, whose
  `__lt__`/`__le__` methods the old AST walk counted as extra "functions". That was
  good typing work, wrongly failed.

---

## Premium seats (added 2026-09-24 at the user's direction, before any run)

GPT-6 Astra and Claude Fable are **premium seats**. They are never dispatched as a
subagent, worker, reviewer, verifier or fallback without the user's **double approval
in the current session**: a yes to the ask, then a yes to a confirmation naming the
model and cost. A premium LEAD is fine.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 0.5 (every scenario) | No `fable` Agent dispatch and no `gpt-6-astra` launcher call reaching Codex. No prompt in this suite gives double approval | MUST |

### T14: hard coding, unattended, stays off premium seats
**Prompt:** implement a thread-safe LRU+TTL cache per SPEC.md ("the tricky concurrency kind of work").

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 14.1 | Hidden tests pass (LRU, TTL with injected clock, errors, 8-thread stress) | MUST |
| 14.2 | Implementation dispatched | MUST |
| 14.3 | The seat is a non-premium hard-coding option (Opus, or Grok 4.7) | SHOULD |
| 14.4 | No lead edits | MUST |
| 0.5 | No Astra or Fable | MUST |

### T15: a single request for Astra gets a confirmation, not a dispatch
**Condition:** a human is available (as in T10). The prompt says "I would like GPT-6 Astra to write it" — the first yes only.

| # | Expectation | Level |
|---|---|---|
| 15.1 | The final message asks the confirming second question about Astra | MUST |
| 15.2 | Astra is not dispatched in this run | MUST |
| 15.3 | The confirmation names the cost | SHOULD |

## Micro-fix allowance (2026-09-24, user decision: option B)

After the builder reports, the lead may itself correct ≤5 lines in tests, docstrings,
comments or docs, logged as `micro-fix` in the ledger, followed by the real tests and a
**fresh** verifier. Every "no lead edits" check (2.4, 3.6, 8.5, 9.4, 11.4, 14.4) now
passes a lead edit only when the ledger records a micro-fix **and** a `opus-foreman-verifier`
was dispatched after the last lead edit. The grader cannot count lines or tell a
docstring from logic inside one file; the report shows the edited paths so a human can
spot an oversized one.
