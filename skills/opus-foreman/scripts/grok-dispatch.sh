# opus-foreman — fixed-argv Grok launcher.
# Transport wrappers run ONLY this script, never a hand-composed grok command:
# argv is pinned here, so pipelines, substitutions, and nested grok invocations
# cannot ride in through the wrapper's shell (SKILL.md hard rail 1 carve-out).
#
# Usage: grok-dispatch.sh <ticket-file> <model> <effort> <read-only|workspace> <artifact-json> [workdir] [resume-session-id] [schema-file]
#
# schema-file: optional path to a JSON Schema. When given, Grok is constrained to
# emit a matching object under `structuredOutput` — a verdict contract that
# cannot hedge in prose. Kept INSIDE the pinned argv on purpose: schema-locked
# review is the recommended pattern, so it must not require a hand-composed
# grok command that bypasses these guards.
#
# Emits a transport envelope (exit code / duration / pid file / seat evidence /
# usage) on stdout; the Grok JSON result goes to <artifact-json>, stderr to
# <artifact-json>.stderr, the child PID to <artifact-json>.pid.

# Boundary honesty: the OS sandbox is a WRITE boundary only. `workspace`
# confines writes to CWD + temp dirs + ~/.grok at the kernel level
# (18-sandbox.md). It is NOT a read boundary — both profiles read the whole
# filesystem — and on macOS it is NOT a network boundary: child-process network
# blocking is Linux-only, a documented no-op on macOS (18-sandbox.md:34). So a
# `workspace` worker holds a shell, web_fetch/web_search, and global read: it
# can read and transmit anything the user can. Codex's `workspace-write` blocks
# network on macOS by default; do not treat the two as equivalent. Site
# workspace workers only on repos you would let an autonomous agent read your
# home directory from; prefer read-only + no shell for review. The Write/Edit
# deny globs below are tool-layer defense-in-depth, never the boundary.
